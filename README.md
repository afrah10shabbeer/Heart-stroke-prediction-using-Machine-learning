# Heart-stroke-prediction-using-Machine-learning
This dataset is used to predict whether a patient is likely to get stroke based on the input parameters like gender, age, various diseases, and smoking status. Each row in the data provides relavant information about the patient. And I've used Support vector machine classification algorithm to predict if a person will have a stroke or not.
